LocalEvents
===========

This repository is for the course project in my MIS507 software design and integration class, in which we designed
a web app where U of A students can explore and manage interesting events in their university community, and implemented it in J2EE framework. At the core of the project, several design patterns are applied to help the project be compatible with future changes, including:

-- Factory method-- Adapter
-- Singleton
